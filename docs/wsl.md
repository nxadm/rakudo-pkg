# Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
If you're using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (aka Bash or Ubuntu on
Windows 10), use the repository or package for the installed Linux
distribution. You'll need to strip the moarvm library of (unused) kernel
functionalities that Windows does not implement yet:

```bash
$ /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/fix-windows10
```
