# rakudo-pkg

`rakudo-pkg` offers native Linux 64-bit packages of the
[Rakudo compiler/runtime for Raku](https://raku.org/) and the
[zef nodule installer](https://github.com/ugexe/zef). The packages track the
upstream releases closely. Most of the time, the packages will be released on
the same day as the Rakudo sources. At the moment, packages are provided for
Alpine, Debian, EL (RHEL/CentOS/Amazon/Oracle Linux), Fedora, openSUSE,
Ubuntu and their derivatives. Additionally, a relocatable build is also
provided that work universally on all recent Linux distributions and need no
installation or root privileges.
